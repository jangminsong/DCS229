Are you under the impression
This isn't your life?
Do you dabble in depression?
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh this is a fact, that you need to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wilco, Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby
Are times getting tough?
Are the roads you travel rough?
Have you had enough of the old?
Tired of being exposed to the cold?
Stare at your stereo
Put on your headphones before you explode, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wilco, Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby
So many wars that just can't be won, oh, oh, oh
Even before the battle's begun, oh, oh, oh
This is all of our arms open wide
Sonic shoulder for you to cry, cry, cry, on
Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh this is a fact that you need to know, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wilco, Wilco, Wilco, Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby
